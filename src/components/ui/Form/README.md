# Form Component Modularization

This directory demonstrates the approach for breaking down the monolithic `Form.tsx` component into smaller, maintainable modules.

## Migration Strategy

The modularization follows a gradual migration approach:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: The `index.ts` file re-exports all original Form components, ensuring existing code continues to work without changes.

2. **Progressive Enhancement**: New modular components are introduced alongside the original ones, allowing teams to gradually adopt the new structure.

3. **Theme Integration**: All new components use the unified theme provider system instead of hardcoded colors.

## Completed Components

- ✅ `FormItem` - Basic form item with icon and content support
- ✅ `FormText` - Theme-aware text component with styling options  
- ✅ `FormToggle` - Toggle component with label and description support

## Usage

```tsx
// Backward compatible - continues to work
import { List, Section, Text } from '@/components/ui/Form';

// New modular approach
import { FormItem, FormText, FormToggle } from '@/components/ui/Form';

// Mixed usage during migration
import Form from '@/components/ui/Form';
const MyComponent = () => (
  <Form.List>
    <Form.Section>
      {/* Original component */}
      <Form.Text>Original text</Form.Text>
      
      {/* New modular component */}
      <Form.ModularText bold>New modular text</Form.ModularText>
    </Form.Section>
  </Form.List>
);
```

## Future Work

To complete the modularization:

1. Extract remaining components: `List`, `Section`, `ScrollView`, `TextField`, `DatePicker`, `Link`
2. Move shared utilities and context providers to separate files
3. Update all usage throughout the codebase to use modular components
4. Remove the original monolithic `Form.tsx` file

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and modify
- **Testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused components won't be included in the bundle
- **Theme Consistency**: All components use the unified theme system
- **Developer Experience**: Better IDE support and faster builds
